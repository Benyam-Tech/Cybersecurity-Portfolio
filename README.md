# Cybersecurity-Portfolio (Under Construction 👷‍♂️)
# 👋 Hi, I'm Benyam
**Cybersecurity Student & Intern 

Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently studying Cybersecurity at Montgomery College ('26) and have experience with IT support and Digital Forensics

This repository is a collection of my technical labs from my from my courses and personal study.

## 🏆 Featured Case Studies (The "Top 5")
*These are my most complex projects, demonstrating skills in SIEM, Cloud Architecture, and Security Engineering.*

### 1. 📂 [Splunk Threat Hunting](./Splunk-Threat-Hunting)
**Skill:** Blue Team / SOC Operations
> Investigated a compromised web server using Splunk. Used SPL (Search Processing Language) to correlate HTTP logs, identifying a specific "Webshell Runner" attack vector and pinpointing the malicious IP source.

### 2. 📂 [AWS IAM Architecture](./AWS-IAM-Policy)
**Skill:** Cloud Governance & Identity
> Designed a "Least Privilege" permission model for a cloud environment. Created custom JSON policies to ensure developers could view resources without having the ability to accidentally delete critical infrastructure.

### 3. 📂 [Automated Malware Analysis Lab](./FLARE-VM-Lab)
**Skill:** Security Engineering & Scripting
> Engineered an isolated Windows environment (FLARE VM) for safe malware analysis. Automated the deployment of tools like Ghidra and x64dbg using PowerShell scripts and Chocolatey package management.

### 4. 📂 [Azure Secure Deployment](./Azure-Infrastructure)
**Skill:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
> Deployed a hardened Linux web server using the Azure CLI. Configured Network Security Groups (NSGs) to block all traffic by default and used automation scripts to install Nginx without manual SSH login.

### 5. 📂 [Endpoint Forensics & Log Analysis](./Endpoint-Forensics)
**Skill:** Incident Response (IR)
> Analyzed system logs on both Windows and Linux endpoints. Successfully identified "Log Clear" events (Event ID 1102)—a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks during a compromise.

* 📂 **[Red Team Operations](./Red-Team-Credential-Dumping)** - Simulating a credential harvesting attack using Mimikatz.
* 📂 **[GCP Infrastructure](./GCP-Infrastructure-CLI)** - Managing cloud resources programmatically via the Google Cloud SDK.
* 📂 **[Linux Access Control](./Linux-Access-Control)** - Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to segregate departmental data.
